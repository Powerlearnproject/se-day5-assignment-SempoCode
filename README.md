**Day 1:** *Introduction to Software Engineering Concepts and AI*


This Day introduces students to fundamental software engineering concepts and the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in software development. Lessons cover the basics of software engineering principles, including the software development lifecycle, methodologies like Agile and Waterfall, and the importance of version control and testing. Building on these foundations, students then explore AI, learning what AI is and how it can be applied in various industries. The Day provides a hands-on experience with AI tools, allowing students to see AI in action through practical activities such as using image recognition demos. Combining software engineering basics and AI prepares students to understand and implement AI solutions within structured software projects.



**Day 2:** *Version Control and CLI Skills*


This combined Day is designed to familiarize students with GitHub and the Command Line Interface (CLI), both of which are essential tools for software developers. Lessons begin with an overview of GitHub, including creating accounts and basic Git commands for version control. Students then learn how to navigate and perform file operations using CLI commands. The Day emphasizes collaboration through GitHub, teaching students to fork repositories, make changes, and create pull requests. Advanced CLI tools, such as text searching with `git bash` and changing file permissions using PowerShell, have also been introduced. Activities include practicing Git commands, contributing to collaborative projects, and mastering file operations in the CLI.



**Day 3:** *Setting Up Your Development Environment*


This Day covers the essential steps to set up a productive development environment. Students learn to choose appropriate tools like code editors and version control systems. Lessons include configuring these tools, such as setting up Git with user details and exploring Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like VS Code. Activities involve installing and configuring software and experimenting with IDE features like extensions and debugging tools to enhance coding efficiency.



**Day 4:** *Software Project Management and Pitching Software Projects*


This Day focused on helping the students understand software project management and the ability to pitch projects. Effective project management involves planning, executing, and overseeing software projects to ensure they meet their objectives on time and within budget. This includes defining project scope, managing resources, and maintaining clear communication among team members. On the other hand, pitching software projects is about convincingly presenting ideas to stakeholders, potential investors, or team members to gain their support and investment. This requires clear articulation of the project's value, goals, and the benefits it will deliver. Both skills are vital for turning technical expertise into impactful software solutions.



**Day 5:** *Technical Writing Skills*


The final Day emphasizes the importance of technical writing in software engineering. Lessons focus on the necessity of clear and concise documentation, providing examples of good and bad practices. Students learn to write effective README files for their projects and use Markdown to format text. Activities include writing documentation for sample projects and practicing Markdown to create well-structured and readable technical documents
